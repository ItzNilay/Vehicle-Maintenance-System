This app allows users to schedule regular maintenance tasks, receive 
notifications for upcoming maintenance, and keep track of vehicle repair history. 
The app is user-friendly, easy to navigate, and can be customized to meet 
individual user needs. The system allows users to set up custom maintenance 
schedules based on time or mileage intervals, record maintenance and repair 
history, track expenses, and generate reports on vehicle performance and cost. 
Some systems may also provide real-time tracking of vehicle location and status, 
enabling fleet managers to optimize vehicle usage and reduce downtime. The use 
of a Vehicle Maintenance System can help improve vehicle reliability, reduce 
maintenance costs, and increase overall efficiency of fleet operations. This project 
report provides a detailed overview of the development process, including the 
project requirements, design, implementation, testing, and deployment phases. The 
report also discusses the challenges encountered during the development process 
and the solutions adopted to overcome them.
